VectorBase Population Biology Map
==================================

## Project description

### What is VectorBase?
VectorBase is a Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) focused on invertebrate vectors of human pathogens. VectorBase is one of four Bioinformatics Resource Centers providing web-based resources to the scientific community, supporting basic and applied research on organisms causing emerging or re-emerging diseases, or considered potential agents of biowarfare or bioterrorism. All VectorBase resources are made freely available to the research community under the GNU General Public License.

### Population Biology in VectorBase
The VectorBase PopBio resource is a database and associated tools for visualisation, search and analysis of a wide range of population data, including genotypes, insecticide resistance and other phenotypes, and field collection metadata. 
Current data includes:

* 13k+ Anopheles gambiae complex samples with inversion and microsatellite genotypes.
30k species distribution observations assimilated by the Malaria Atlas Project
* 200+ individuals with high-throughput sequencing-based genotypes
* 5500+ insecticide resistance assays

### The Map

You can interactively query all geo-tagged data (>99% of samples) using the map interface. Text-based search and browse is also available.
